## Bugs and Feature Requests

The preferred way to report bugs or request features is to use
[GitHub issues](issues). For this project, however, that feature is not
available.

## Pull Requests

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (if you don't have one already)
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this project
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Submit a pull request

Before you submit a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your
forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

- If the pull request adds or changes a functionality, make sure the
documentation is also created or updated  as part of the same pull request.
- Try not to put more than one feature or bug fix in a single pull request. Create a
separate pull request for each feature or bug fix.
- Squash your commits into one for each pull request: `git reset --soft HEAD~<NUMBER_OF_COMMITS> && git commit`.
